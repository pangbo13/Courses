%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.
